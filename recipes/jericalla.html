<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Jericalla is a Mexican custard dessert made with just a few ingredients. It has a custard like texture similar to flan, 
    and a burned top like crème brûlée. However there isn’t a sugar topping, so you won’t get a hard shell</p>

        <li>1/3 cup of Sugar</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Place milk, sugar and cinnamon, vanilla in a saucepan over medium heat</li>
        <li>Stir constantly for about 20 minutes. After everything has mixed well, turn off the

        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until blended. </li>

        <li>Using a sieve or fork and remove the cinnamon pieces</li>

        <li>Pour mixture equally among 6 ramekin pots or heat-resistant dessert dishes</li>
        <li>Place ramekin pots in a deep pyrex dish and add boiling water into the pyrex dish, taking care not to add water to ramekin pots.</li>
        <li>Fill the pyrex dish about halfway of the pots or about 1 inch (bain marie)</li>
        <li>Bake in oven for 35 minutes</li>
        <li>To check if it is ready, place a toothpick in the center of one of the ramekin pots. If it comes out clean, the jericalla is ready.</li>
        <li>Optional. To give the jericalla a burned effect, brown the ramekin pots under broiler for an extra 4 to 6 minutes or until tops are golden </li>
    </ol>
