<h3>Description</h3>
<body>
    <p>Pozole, AKA posole or pozolé, is a traditional Mexican soup. Because making it is labor-intensive and time-consuming, 
        it’s often a treat for special occasions. Those who grew up with pozole associate it with family and festivities.</p>
    <p>I may be biased because I love it, but if you haven’t tried pozole, you need to ASAP. It’s rare to find somebody 
        who’s tried pozole who doesn’t like it.</p>
    <p>Pozole comes from the Nahuatl word “pozilli,” meaning “foam.” Nahuatl was the language of the Aztecs, an indigenous 
        people of modern-day Mexico</p>
    <p>Pozole is made with hominy, which is processed corn with the germ removed, and meat, traditionally pork. It’s also often 
        made with chicken, especially for those who don’t eat pork. The stew is seasoned with a combination of spices, and it’s 
        typically topped with garnishes like radishes, avocados and lime juice</p>
