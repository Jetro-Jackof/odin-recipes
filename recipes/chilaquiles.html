        <li>Fry the tortillas: n a large sauté pan, coat pan generously with corn oil, (1/8 inch), heat on medium high to high.

    </ol>
        <h4>Red chile Sauce</h4>
    <p>Take 4 dried ancho chiles, remove seeds, stems, and veins. Heat chiles lightly on a skillet on medium heat to draw out their flavor. 
        Put chilies in a saucepan, pour boiling hot water over to cover. Let sit for 15 minutes. Add chiles, 2 garlic cloves, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 
        and 1 1/2 cups of chile soaking liquid to a blender. Hold down lid of blender tightly while blending, blend until completely puréed. Strain
